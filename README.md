This repository contains the supporting materials for the following paper:

Phillips, J., Ong, D. C., Surtees, A. D. R., Xin, Y., Williams, S., Saxe, R., & Frank, M. C. (in prep). A second look at automatic false belief representation: reconsidering Kovács, Téglás, and Endress (2010).

The analysis code (in R) is in "full analysis all experiments.R". The code will read in the various datafiles ("studyX.csv") and perform the same analyses that we report in the paper, along with code to produce the graphs.

A sample of our experiment used in Studies 1a and 1b (i.e. the online direct replicationss) is also included in the repo (other experiments and stimuli available upon request). It takes approximately 20-25 minutes to finish the entire experiment. If you do finish it, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had this been running live.
The complete experiment can be loaded using the following link:
