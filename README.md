This repository contains the supporting materials for the following paper:

Phillips, J.*, Ong, D. C.*, Surtees, A. D. R., Xin, Y., Williams, S., Saxe, R., & Frank, M. C. (in prep). A second look at automatic false belief representation: reconsidering Kovács, Téglás, and Endress (2010).

The analysis code (in R) is in "full analysis all experiments_For_Paper.R". The code will read in the various datafiles ("studyX.csv") and perform the same analyses that we report in the paper, along with code to produce the graphs.

A sample of our experiment used in Studies 1a and 1b (i.e. the online direct replicationss) can be found at :
It takes approximately 20-25 minutes to finish the entire experiment.
