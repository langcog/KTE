### Analysis code

The analysis code (in R) is in "full analysis all experiments.R". The code will read in the various datafiles ("studyX.csv") and perform the same analyses that we report in the paper, along with code to reproduce the graphs.

### Data

Anonymized data for each study is in "studyX.csv"


### Experiments

All the experiments used in all the online studies are also included in the repo. (In lab studies will appear here soon)

It takes approximately 20-25 minutes to finish each experiment. If you do finish it, you'll also see a mockup of the data that would've been collected, had this been running live.
The complete experiments can be loaded using the following links:

The videos used in the experiments can be found in the relevant experiment folders, under videos (e.g. KTE_StudyX/videos). 
We have included the videos used in the lab experiment (Studies 1c/2b), in the folder "Lab Stimuli".
